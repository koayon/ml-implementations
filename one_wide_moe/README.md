# Experiments inspired by `One Wide FeedForward Layer Is All You Need` (Apple Paper)

Experiments:

- Confirm results on TinyStories with a small-ish model
  - Compare original regular dense network with shared parameter version with wide shared parameter version
- See the trade-off using MoE for the shared wide layer.
- Try sharing parameters in the MoE with Group Layers.
