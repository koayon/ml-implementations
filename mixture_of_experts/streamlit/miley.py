MILEY = """Miley Ray Cyrus (/ˈmaɪli ˈsaɪrəs/ MY-lee SY-rəs; born Destiny Hope Cyrus, November 23, 1992) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Dubbed the "Pop Chameleon", she has been recognized for her musical versatility and continual artistic reinventions.[3] Cyrus has been referred to as the "Teen Queen" of the 2000s pop culture[4] and regarded as one of the few examples of a child star who went on to have a successful career as an adult.[5] Among her accolades are 19 Teen Choice Awards, four World Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, a People's Choice Award, a GLAAD Media Award, and eight Guinness World Records. She was ranked as the ninth-greatest Billboard 200 female artist of all time, and has been featured in listicles such as the Time 100 in 2008 and 2014, Forbes 30 Under 30 in 2014 and 2021, and Billboard's "Greatest of All Time Artists" in 2019.[6]

One of six siblings, Cyrus is the second daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. She emerged as a teen idol while portraying the titular character of the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana (2006–2011). As Hannah Montana, she attained two number-one and three top-five soundtracks on the Billboard 200, and the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 top-ten single "He Could Be the One." Cyrus's initial solo career consisted of the teen-friendly pop rock U.S. number-one albums Meet Miley Cyrus (2007) and Breakout (2008); these releases contained the US top-ten singles "See You Again" and "7 Things." The extended play The Time of Our Lives (2009), peaked at number two in the U.S; its lead single "Party in the U.S.A." became one of the best-selling singles in the United States and was certified diamond by the RIAA. Cyrus also released the country pop ballad "The Climb", which peaked at number four. Trying to reinvent her image, she explored dance-pop in her third album, Can't Be Tamed (2010). The record received mixed reviews; however, its title track reached the top ten in the U.S.

Following a hiatus, she underwent a mature and provocative musical shift with the R&B and hip hop-infused Bangerz (2013). Featuring the top-five single "We Can't Stop" and Cyrus's first U.S. number-one "Wrecking Ball," it became her fifth number-one album and earned Cyrus her first Grammy Award nomination. She experimented with psychedelic music on her follow-up, the free album Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015), embraced country pop on Younger Now (2017), which yielded the U.S. top-ten single "Malibu", and incorporated trap on the EP She Is Coming (2019). Cyrus explored rock on Plastic Hearts (2020), which topped the Billboard Top Rock Albums chart. Her next, Endless Summer Vacation (2023), was preceded by the lead single "Flowers," which set several streaming records and became her second U.S. number-one single."""
